HLL : high level language like C, input to the compiler

    1. Lexical Analysis (LA) => Stream of tokens
    2. Syntax Analysis (SA) => Parse Tree (hence step #2 is called parser sometimes)
    3. Semantic Analysis (SMA) => Parse Tree (symantically verified)
    4. Intermediate Code Generation (IC) => Three Address Code
    5. Code optimization (CO) => Optimized Intermediate Code
    6. Target Code Generation (TCG) => Target Code.

    All phases of compiler will interact with Symbol table manager and Error handling module.

    Steps 1-4 are known as Front-end, while 5-6 as Back-end.
