// Lexical Analyser :

    Only phase which reads actual program character by character, only this phase knows about the line numbers where each token appears.

    Main tasks of the phase :
        1. Convert lexems into tokens.
        2. Removing comments and whitespace.

// Syntax Analyser :

    takes grammar and tokens as input.

    If grammar generates more than one parse trees or LMD or RMD for a string then the grammar is ambiguous.
    Most parsers don't allow ambiguous grammars so we have toconvert
