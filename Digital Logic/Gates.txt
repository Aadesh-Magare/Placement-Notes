when input values are changed output is changed almost instantaneously, delayed only by the propagation time of singals through gate, known as gate delay.

// Functionally complete set of gates :
    any boolean function can be implemented by using only gates in the set.

General gate outputs:
input : A, B

AND : A.B
OR : A + B
NOT : ~A
NAND : ~(A.B)
NOR : !(A + B)
XOR : A~B + B~A
