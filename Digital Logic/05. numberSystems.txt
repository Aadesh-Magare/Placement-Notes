// Decimal system:
    base or radix : 10
    
    47.56 = 4 * 10^1 + 7 * 10^0 + 5 * 10^-1 + 6 * 10^-2

// Binary system:
    base or radix : 2
    
    101.11 = 1 * 2^2 + 0 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^0 + 1 * 2^-1 + 1 * 2^-2

    // Binary to Decimal :
        multiply by proper powers of 2 and sum 

    // Decimal to Binary :

        // Integar part :
            repeated division by 2 gives Binary representation of number from lsb to msb.

        // Fractional part :
            multiply Fractional part by 2, the integar part of multiplication result is the msb of binary number.
            consider fractional part of result for further calculation, stop when desired no of bits are found.

// Hexadecimal system:
    base or radix : 16

    // Hex to binary or binary to hex :
        group of 4 digits in binary forms a digit in hex.
