Basic logical operations:
AND = .
OR = +
NOT = overbar (-)

De morgans theoram :
    not(A.B) = not A + not B
    not(A+B) = not A . not B
    
Important simplifications:
~a + ab = ~a + b    (can be proved by taking complement)
a + ~ab = a + b

Functionally complete operation set :
    set of logic functions from which any arbitrary boolean function can be realized.
    e.g.
        1. OR, AND, NOT
        2. NAND
        3. NOR
        4. XOR, AND
        5. 2 to 1 multiplexer.
