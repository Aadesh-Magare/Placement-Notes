// Basic logical operations:
    AND = .
    OR = +
    NOT = overbar (-)

// De morgans theorem :
    ~(A.B) = ~ A + ~ B
    ~(A+B) = ~ A . ~ B
    
// Important simplifications (Absorption Laws) :
    ~a + ab = ~a + b    (can be proved by taking complement)
    a + ~ab = a + b
    a + ab = a 

// Consensus theorem :
    xy + ~xz  + yz = xy + ~xz

// Functionally complete operation set :
    set of logic functions from which any arbitrary boolean function can be realized.
    e.g.
        1. OR, AND, NOT
        2. NAND
        3. NOR
        4. XOR, AND
        5. 2 to 1 multiplexer.

// Principle of Duality:
    Dual of ~x + ~y => ~x . ~y
    It's different from complement since in dual only operator and constants (0,1) are negated not the variables.
     
// Representation of function :
    // min term : 
        a product term which contain all variables present in function in complemented form or un-complemented form.
            e.g. for function on variables a, b, c
            min terms are abc, a~bc, ~abc etc.
        a min terms gives output 1 for exactly one combination of it's terms.
    // Canonical sum of products (disjunctive normal form) :
        sum of all min terms for which function assumes value 1. 
    
    // Max term :
        a sum term which contain all variables present in function in complemented or un-complemented form.
         e.g. for function on variables a, b, c
            min terms are a+b+c, ~a+b+~c etc
        a max term gives output 0 for exactly one combination of it's terms.
    // Canonical product of sums (conjunctive normal form) :
        product of all max terms for which function assumes value 0.

    Canonical SOP or POS forms are unique for a particular function.
    functions with identical Canonical SOP or POS forms are said to be equivalent functions.

    SOP circuit can be easily realized by using NAND gates alone. 
// Neutral functions:
    having equal no of min terms and max terms.
    no of Neutral functions : (2^n) C (2^n-1)

// Self-dual : 
    if a function and it's dual are equal then it's called self-dual.
    
    It's closed under complement.
    
    conditions for Self-dual :
        function must be Neutral (no of min terms = max terms)
        function doesn't contain two mutually exclusive terms.
            e.g. ABC -  ~A~B~C
                 A~B~c - ~ABC   are mutually exclusive terms.

    No of Self-dual functions possible for n variable function :
        2^(2 ^ (n-1)) : 2 raised to (2 raised to n-1)
