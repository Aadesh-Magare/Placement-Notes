when input values are changed output is changed almost instantaneously, delayed only by the propagation time of signals through gate, known as gate delay.

// Functionally complete or universal operations :
    a set of operations which can represent any switching function.

    a set is functionally complete if we can derive a set from it which is known to be functionally complete.

    If a set is functionally complete after taking support from 0 or 1.
    i.e. without using 0 or 1 explicitly it's not possible to prove functionally complete property then it's called partial functionally complete.
    
// Functionally complete set of gates :
    any boolean function can be implemented by using only gates in the set.

// Positive logic system :
    when high voltage is treated as 1 and low voltage as 0.
// Negative logic system :
    when high voltage is treated as 0 and logic voltage as 1.

    If we change the logic system from +ve to -ve or vice versa the effect is same as taking dual.
    
General gate outputs:
input : A, B

AND : A.B
OR : A + B
NOT : ~A
NAND : ~(A.B)
NOR : !(A + B)
XOR : A~B + B~A (XOR acts like sum modulo 2 function)
