Binary Heaps are used for sorting in heapsort

Heapify procedure is used to build an heap from array

heapify can be applied to a node only if its children are already heapified, so its done bottom up

we start with the lowest level non-leaf, i.e. the node which has only one level of children below it

//TO Build HEAP:

if array a[0..n] then we start from a[n/2] down to index 0
	on each index we call heapify procedure

Heapify is recursive procedure , it checks left and right child of a node and finds out which is max from the three (root, left, right) it places the max on root and calls heapify on faulty children

to heapsort :
	swap the root with last element of array, reduce the size of heap by one and call heapify on the root
	
							while(n > 1){
								swap(a[0], a[n-1]);
								n--;
								heapify(a, 0, n);
							}
