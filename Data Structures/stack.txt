//Implement Stack using Queue :
	
	using two queues it can be implemented. we can do either push or pop at constant time but not both for either one of them, we have to transfer all elements from one queue to another.
	//1 costly pop

		q1 : 2 3 4 5 6
		q2 : 

		pop(s)

		q1: 6 
		q2: 2 3 4 5 

		pop and return last element of q1 and rename queues 

		q2 : 
		q1 : 2 3 4 5

	//2 costly push
		//on each push maintain latest element at beginning of queue.
		push(s,6)

		q1 : 2 3 4 5
		q2 : 6

		q1: 
		q2: 6 2 3 4 5

		exchange names
		q2:
		q1 : 6 2 3 4 5
