//Macros Related :

	A predefined macro __FILE__ contains the location of a C program file, it's used in program to print its own source code.

	//#pragma once 
		this avoids include of files multiple times.
//Static :
	Static functions in C can be called from same file (in which its declared) only.

//Precedence :

	~ (not) > & (bitwise and) > ^ (xor) > | (or) > && (logical and ) > || (or)

//Pointer to specific location :
	unsigned int *ptr = (unsigned int *) 0x123;
	//typecast is important.

//Max memory :
	malloc can allocate max 64K memory to get more you should use farmalloc and farfree functions.

//Malloc and Calloc
	calloc will initialize memory to zero while malloc doesnt.

//sprintf :
	its used to print output to a string buffer instred of stdout.

//Function Pointers array :
	// array of 3 function pointers.
	float (*ptr[3]) (int, int);
        ptr[0] = &myfun1;
        (*ptr[0])(3, 4);

//BitFields :
	you can specify that certain variables will use only 1 bit (or n bits), then compiler will allow them that many bits only. saves memory.
			struct{
			  unsigned int widthValidated : 1;
			  unsigned int heightValidated : 1;
			} status;

//Volatile variable :
	volatilve int x;
	tells compiler that x is volatilve variable i.e. its value can be changed by external things i.e. not by this code.
	Volatile variables are useful when multi-threaded programs have global variables and any thread can modify these shared variables.
