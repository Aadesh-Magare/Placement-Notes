on seeing particular input, it can go to only one state from the current state.


complement of DFA :
    all other properties in tuple remain same excep the final state.
    change all final states from original DFA to non-final and non-final states to final .

Reversal of DFA :
    draw the states as it is.
    swap initial and final states.
    change the direction of arrows. (i.e. transition on given input)

    on reversal it's possible to get NFA for DFA's reversal.
