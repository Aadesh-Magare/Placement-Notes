on seeing a particular input, you can end up in many states from the current state.

most of real life machines are DFA.
NFA machines are not real, theoratical concept.

if for some state, its not defined where it goes on seeing a particular symbol, we say that it goes to null state.

NFA will always have less no of states than corresponding DFA. hence no of states in minimal DFA will be greater than or equal to no of states in corresponding minimal NFA.

// Conversion of NFA to DFA :

    first draw NFA.
    construct state transition table :
        states as rows and input symbols as columns.
        add entries for all transitions in NFA.
    
    e.g.

                a       b
        A       {A,B}   {A}

        B       {C}     {C}                

        C       {}      {}


    convet the table into state transition table for DFA:
        for fields with multiple states ( {A,B}) create a new combined state with the name of those states (AB)
        only include those states which are reachable from state symbol.
        for adding transitions for combined state, take union of rows for those states from NFA's transition table.
        initial state will remain same in both cases
        final state in DFA will be all those states which contain final state from NFA.

// Complement of NFA:
    when DFA is complemented language getting accepted by it gets complemented as well but that's not the case with NFA.

    the language accepted by NFA need not get complemented when NFA is complemented, it may get complemented but not always.
