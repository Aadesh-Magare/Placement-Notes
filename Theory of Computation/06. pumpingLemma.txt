// For Regular Languages:
    if an infinite language does not have any repeating pattern then it's not regular language. if such pattern exists then it may be regular.

    It's used to prove irregularity of languages.
    If a language does not satisfy pumping lemma then its not regular language. but it can't be used to prove that language is regular.

    For regular language L, there exists a number n (pumping length), such that for all x belongs L with length(x) >= n following holds true:
        x = uvw i.e. divide the string in three parts such that
        1. length(uv) <= n
        2. length(v) >= 1
        3. for all i >= 0 : uv^iw belongs to L.

// For Context-Free Languages:
    It's used to prove that language is not Context-Free.
    If a language does not satisfy pumping lemma then its not Context-Free language. but it can't be used to prove that language is Context-Free.

    For Context-Free language L, there exists a number n (pumping length), such that for all x belongs L with length(x) >= n following holds true:
        x = uvxyz ie divide the string in five parts such that
        1. length(vxy) <= n
        2. length(vy) >= 1
        3. for all i >= 0 : uv^ixy^iz belongs to L.
