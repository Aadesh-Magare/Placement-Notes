It accepts recursively enumerable language generated by type-0 grammar.

A turing machine consists of a tape of infinite length on which read and writes operation can be performed. The tape consists of infinite cells on which each cell either contains input symbol or
a special symbol called blank. It also consists of a head pointer which points to cell currently being read and it can move in both directions.

Turing machine is expressed as 7 tuple where :
    Q : finite set of states
    T : tape alphabet (which can be written on tape)
    B : blank symbol.
    sigma : input alphabet.
    delta : transition function Q * T -> Q * T * {L, R} Depending on current state,
            current tape alphabet it will move to new state, change the tape symbol and move head to Left or Right
    q : initial state
    F : set of final states.

Non-Deterministic TM and Deterministic TM have same power.

There can be TM with multiple tapes with separate head pointer for each, but it has same power as single tape TM. and both are interconvertible.
