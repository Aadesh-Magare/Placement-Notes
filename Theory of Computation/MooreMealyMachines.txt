These are FA with output. Both are deterministic.
Described by 6 tuple :
    Q : finite set of states
    q : initial state
    Sigma : input alphabet
    delta : transition function Q * Sigma = Q
    triangle : output alphabet. (symbols which will be outputed)
    lambda : output function. (will determine what will be the output)

// Moore machine :
    lambda : Q -> triangle
    i.e. the output depends on state only.

    for input of length n, it will produce output of length n+1. since the initial state will also produce output without any input.

// Mealy machine :
    lambda : Q * Sigma = triangle.
    i.e. the output depends on state as well as input alphabet.

    for input of length n, it well produce output of length n. because each output depends on input symbol.
