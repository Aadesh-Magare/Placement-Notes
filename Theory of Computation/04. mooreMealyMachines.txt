These are FA with output. Both are deterministic.
Described by 6 tuple :
    Q : finite set of states
    q : initial state
    Sigma : input alphabet
    delta : transition function Q * Sigma = Q
    triangle : output alphabet. (symbols which will be outputed)
    lambda : output function. (will determine what will be the output)

// Moore machine :
    lambda : Q -> triangle
    i.e. the output depends on state only.

    for input of length n, it will produce output of length n+1. since the initial state will also produce output without any input.

// Mealy machine :
    lambda : Q * Sigma = triangle.
    i.e. the output depends on state as well as input alphabet.

    for input of length n, it well produce output of length n. because each output depends on input symbol.

// Conversion of Moore to Mealy : Both have same power and can be interconverted.

    1. remove output associated with the states.
    2. for each transition, see the state to which it is going (destination) and associate the output from that state to the transition.

    No of states does not change during this conversion.
// Conversion of Mealy to Moore :

    Procedure is opposite to that of Moore to Mealy.
    1. For each transition, move the output from transition to the destination state.
    2. If the destination state already has output associated with it, create a new state with same name and this new output.
    3. If at the end some state does not have any output (because it did not had any incoming edge) then the state can have any output it won't matter.

    From the process it's clear that during this Conversion the number of states may increase.

    For Mealy machine, if we have N states and M outputs then the corresponding Moore machine can have N * M number of states.
