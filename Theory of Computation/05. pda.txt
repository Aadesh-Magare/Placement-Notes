Push down automata : FA + Stack.
// 7 tuple consisting of :

    Q : finite set of states
    sigma : input symbol
    delta : transition function.
    q : initial state.
    Z0 : bottom of the Stack
    F : set of final states.
    ~ : stack alphabet (symbols that can be present in stack)

    PDA is of two types just like FA:
        // Deterministic PDA:
            same as DFA where along with input symbol it also considers a symbol from top of the stack and goes to a single state and push output on top of stack.
        // Non-Deterministic PDA :
            same as NFA where along with input symbol it also considers a symbol from top of stack and can go to many states and push output on top of stack.
        
        there are some languages that Non-Deterministic PDA can accept but Deterministic PDA cannot.
    
    sample transition function for PDA :
        transition function delta:
            delta(q0, a, Z0) = (q0, aZ0)
            currently in state q0, on seeing input a and top of stack is Z0, then go to state q0, and push a and Z0 onto stack (pushing Z0 because while checking the top of stack it got removed)

            delta(q0, b, a) = (q1, e)
            currently in state q0, on seeing input b and top of stack a, then go to state q1, and push epsilon onto stack (i.e. nothing, we want to remove a for every matched b in input)

    PDA can accept strings in two ways : acceptance by final state and acceptance by empty stack.

    if PDA comes across a transition that is not defined it goes into dead state and program is halted.

    PDA cannot accept a language like a^nb^mc^nd^m :
        since we have to match no of a with no of c but till the time c comes up in input we have already pushed b onto the stack, no way to compare c against a. hence PDA can't accept this language.

        language like a^nb^nc^n :
        since we have to match no of a, b and c. by the time c comes up in input the stack is already empty nothing to compare against. hence PDA won't accept language like this.

    Non-Deterministic PDA is used to match a string like ww^r while Deterministic PDA can match wcw^r string.
