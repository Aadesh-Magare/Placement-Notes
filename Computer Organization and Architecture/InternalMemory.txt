two forms are SRAM and DRAM. SRAM is faster, expensive, less dense. SRAM is used in cache and DRAM is used in main memory.

// DRAM :
    it's made with cells that store data as charge on capacitors. presence or absence of charge is 1 or 0. capacitors have natural tendency to loose charge, so need to periodically refresh hence called as dynamic.

    although dram cell is used to store 1 or 0, it's essentially anaglog device. The capacitor can store any charge within a range, a threshhold value determines whether the charge is interpreted as 1 or 0.

    DRAM cell is simpler and smaller than SRAM cell, thus DRAM is more dense and less expensive.
// SRAM :
    uses traditional flip-flop logic gate configurations to store bit.


// ROM :
    read only memory.
    
    // PROM : programmable ROM, needs special equipment to program.

    // Read-Mostly memory :
        frequest reads, rare write.
        
        // Erasable PROM : can be erased with special equipment and written again.

        // Electically Erasable PROM : does not require special equipment, can be written again.

        // Flash memory : performance and cost in between EPROM and EEPROM
