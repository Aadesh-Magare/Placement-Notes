I/O module interfaces process and memory via system bus/ switch to one or more peripheral devices.

// Programmed I/O :
    there are no interrupts, processor issues read/write request to I/O module and later on has to periodically check for its completion.

// Interrupt-driven I/O :
    processor issues read/write request and goes on to do other work, its interrupted when I/O operation is complete.

// Direct memory access :
    other methods require active participation by processor during data transfer from I/O to memory.
    in dma additional module is present on system bus which mimicks processor during data transfer and releaves processor from the job.

    processor initiates the transfer and delegates the operation to dma module which gives an interrupt when transfer is complete, so processor is involved only during starting and ending.

    // Cycle steling :
        dma module needs to use system bus to transfer data, so it must use bus when processor is not using it or suspend processor's operation temporarily.

        latter technique is more common and is called as Cycle steling, cause dma module steals a bus Cycle.
