The rate at which sender sends packets should not be too greater than receiver's processing rate else the receiver queue might get full and cause subsequent packages to be discarded.


// Capacity of link :
    number of bits that the chanel or link or wire can hold.
    Capacity = bandwidth * Tp
    For full Duplex, Capacity = 2 * bandwidth * Tp
    
// RoundTripTime (RTT) = 2 * Propagation delay
// TimeOut (TO) =  2 * RTT
// Time To Live (TTL) = 2 * TimeOut. (Maximum TTL is 180 seconds)
// ARQ protocol : Automatic Repeat Request.
    It needs error detection, reciever feedback and retransmission facility.

// Stop and wait :
	
    Sender sends one packet and waits till it recieves ACK or NAK from other side, on NAK it resends packet and on ACK it takes new packet to send.

    when a packet is lost before reaching receiver there is no ack. This is packet loss problem to solve this timeout is added to Stop and wait flow. 
	Server resends packet after some time if ACK is not recieved. this time should be more than round trip time.

    In case ack is lost, sender will send previous packet again after timeout but receiver will receive it as a new packet hence sequence number is added to the packet.
    sender keeps a field called sequence no in the packet for reciver to identify new packets from the retransmitted packets.
    For similar reasons ack will also have sequence number.

    efficiency = useful time / total cycle time
               = Tt / Tt + 2 * Tp
               = 1 / 1 + 2 * a
    where a : Tp / Tt 
    
    Throughput or Effective bandwidth or bandwidth utilization : no of bits being sent per unit time
        Throughput = L / Tt + 2 * Tp 
        L : size of packet.

        Throughput = efficiency * bandwidth

	stop and wait does not utilize the bandwidth since it keep waiting. so pipelining protocol is introduced.


// Pipelining :
    instead of sending single packet, send window of packets during the wait time. hence increase the efficiency. after you get ack of a packet that packet can be removed from window. This is called as sliding window protocol.

    For maximum efficiency the window size should be 1 + 2a (from efficiency formula)
    Sequence numbers in packet should be as small as possible since storing large number in packet will increase size. 
        Minimum sequence number = 1 + 2a
        Bits required in sequence number field to represent this log(1+2a) (log base 2)

    If no of bits in sequence number is N then we can have at max 2^N sequence numbers. Hence we cannot send more than this number of packets in one window. hence window size is also limited by size of sequence number field.
        window size = min(1+2a, 2^N)

    // Go Back N :
        N should be > 1, otherwise there is no Pipelining.
        1. Sender window size is N.
        2. Receiver window size is always 1 : due to this if receiver is waiting for a packet and receives next sequence packets (due to some delay or packet getting lost). it will discard all packets until it receives intended packet.
        So sender will have to go back and send these packets again hence the name go back N. Sender has to go back N from the most recent packet not the lost packet.

            This means on every packet loss sender will re-transmit entire window of the lost packet.
        3. Ack :
            Ack can be 
                1. independent : one ack for every packet.
                    high reliable but high traffic
                    loss of one ack means loss of just one packet. 
                2. Cumulative : one ack for group of packet.
                    less traffic but less reliable since one loss of ack means entire group is lost. 

            Go back N uses Cumulative ack : Cumulative ack can use timer instead of number of packets to be consistent.
        
        Go back N discards packet silently. If a packet is corrupted then it's discarded silently as well.

        To solve the problem of duplicate packet the available sequence numbers in Any protocol should be >= ws+wr
            i.e. sequence numbers should be more than sender and receiver window sizes.

    //  Selective Repeat :
            1. sender window size > 1
            2. Receiver window size = sender window size
                hence when a packet is lost sender has to send only that packet again. i.e. it has to repeat selectively.

                Re-transmition in this case is same as stop and wait and much lower than go back N. Efficiency is same as go back N when window size is same. 
            3. Ack :
                uses independent ack.
                in case of corrupted packet it will send negative ack. this allows sender to resent the packet even before it's timeout has expired.


// Congestion Policy in TCP :

    1. Slow Start Phase: starts slowly increment is exponential to threshold
    2. Congestion Avoidance Phase: After reaching the threshold increment is by 1
    3. Congestion Detection Phase: Sender goes back to Slow start phase or Congestion avoidance phase.
        The only way a sender can guess that congestion has occurred is the need to retransmit a segment.
            Case 1 : Retransmission due to Timeout – In this case congestion possibility is high.
                (a) ssthresh is reduced to half of the current window size.
                (b) set cwnd = 1
                (c) start with slow start phase again.

            Case 2 : Retransmission due to 3 Acknowledgement Duplicates – In this case congestion possibility is less.
                (a) ssthresh value reduces to half of the current window size.
                (b) set cwnd= ssthresh
                (c) start with congestion avoidance phase
