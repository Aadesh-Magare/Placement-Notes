// Transmission delay :
    time taken by host to put packet onto outgoing link.
            Tt = L / B
            L : length of packet
            B : bandwidth of network.
    
    K, M and G in terms of bandwidth and data (packet size) are different.
    e.g.
        1K data => 1024 bits
        1Kbps   => 1000 bits/sec

// Propagation delay :
    time taken by data to reach from sender to receiver.
        Tp = d / v
        d : distance to be covered
        v : velocity with which signals travel (e.g. 70% of v of light)

    Round Trip Time (RTT) = 2 * Tp
    
// Queuing delay (Tq) :
    time spent by the packet in the receiver queue before it is processed.

// Processing delay (Tpro):
    time taken by receiver to process the packet.

    Tq and Tpro are generally considered zero unless given since they depend on receiver and no formula to calculate them.
