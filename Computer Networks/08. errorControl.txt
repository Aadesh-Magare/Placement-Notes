There can be two kinds of errors 
// Packet Loss :
    Retransmission solves it, ack is used for detection.
// Packet Corrupted :
    some bits get changed due to external things.

    // Error detection : 
        detect whether packet is Corrupted or not.
        we can ask for Retransmission.
        ways to detect:
            Parity check
            CRC : Cyclic redundancy check.
            Checksum

    // Error correction :
        we know packet is corrupted and are able to correct it also.
        ways to correct:
            Hamming code
