There can be two kinds of errors 
// Packet Loss :
    Retransmission solves it, ack is used for detection.
// Packet Corrupted :
    some bits get changed due to external things.
    // Error detection : 
        detect whether packet is Corrupted or not.
        we can ask for Retransmission.
        ways to detect:
            Simple Parity check :
                1 is added to the block if it contains odd number of 1’s, and
                0 is added if it contains even number of 1’s
                This scheme makes the total number of 1’s even, that is why it is called even parity checking.
            Two-Dimensional Parity Check :
                Parity check bits are calculated for each row and each column.
            Checksum :
                1. data is divided into k segments each of m bits.
                2. In the sender’s end the segments are added using 1’s complement arithmetic to get the sum. The sum is complemented to get the checksum.
                3. At the receiver’s end, all received segments are added (including the segment with checksum) using 1’s complement arithmetic to get the sum. The sum is complemented.
                4. If the result is zero, the received data is accepted; otherwise discarded.
            CRC : Cyclic redundancy check.
                CRC is based on binary division.
                
    // Error correction :
        we know packet is corrupted and are able to correct it also.
        ways to correct:
            Hamming code
