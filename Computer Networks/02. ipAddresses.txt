// IP addresses :
    
    32 bit addresses in ipv4 i.e. 2^32 total addresses.
    Dotted Decimal Representation : devide 32 bit address into 4 parts of 8 bit, convert them to decimal numbers and join with dot.
    
    Total classified into 5 classes : A, B, C, D and E
    
    half of 2^32 => starting with 0     => class A
    half of 2^31 => starting with 10    => class B
    half of 2^30 => starting with 110   => class C
    half of 2^29 => starting with 1110  => class D
    half of 2^29 => starting with 1111  => class E

    // class A :

        32 bit => 8 bit network ID + 24 bit host Id
                all addresses start with 0, so there are total 2^7 available addresses, out of which first (all 0) and last (all 1) are not used. so 126 NIds.
          
    // class B :

        32 bit => 16 bit NId + 16 bit host Id
                all addresses start with 10, so there are total 2^14 available addresses. 
                so 16k Nids.
    
    // class C :
        32 bit => 24 bit Nid + 8 bit host Id
                all addresses start with 110, so there are total 2^21 available addresses.
                so 2M Nids.
    
    // class D and class E :
        32 bit => no Nid or host Id limits specified.
                there are 2^28 addresses in either class.
                class D is used for multicasting and class E is reserved.

    First host Id of the class (with all 0) is used to identify the whole network along with Nid. hence it's not assigned to any host. 
        e.g. 12.0.0.0 => represents the network with Nid 12 and not any particular host.
    Also last host Id of the class (with all 1) is used as directed broadcast address of the network. hence it's not assigned to any host.
        e.g. 12.255.255.255 => represents broadcast address of the network with Nid 12 and not any particular host.
    This reduces the number of hosts that can be cofigured with given class IP addresses by 2.

// Casting :
    sending packet from one host to another.

    // Unicast : from one host to another host.

    // Broadcast : from one host to many hosts.
        // Limited :
            Host sending packets to all hosts in the same network. (it's sent out to address 255.255.255.255 and received by everyone in that network)
        // Directed :
            Host sending packets to all hosts in some other network. (it's sent out to 
            address Nid.255.255.255 and received by everyone in that network)
