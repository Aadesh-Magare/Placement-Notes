Features:
    bookmark / pin an item (maybe external items in future)
    ability to add/remove from public board (history of this activity should be maintained)
    ability to merge similar knowledge boards (union like operation, should not be manual merging like code merging)
    ability to share knowledge board with unique urls
    ordering of items in board e.g. by name, types, custom by user
    suggestions of content/board based on topics and usage 
    public boards can have filter by user where only content added by that user will be presented.

Ideas:

    1. public namespace i.e Khub/Java => will be same for everyone
        Pros:
            1. will work like wiki (community driven)
            2. Gamification can be done here on the usage of your contribution to public board
        Cons:
            1. different boards with similar names e.g. jsp, j233, java (solution: ability to merge them / suggestions about existing similar boards)
            2. namespace will get dirty

    2. user namespace i.e. khub/rajeev/java => will be different for everyone, can be shared and all
        Pros:
            1. private space can be created (user can decide the board to be private, public, shared with some people)

        Cons:
            1. multiple boards with same names/content => confusion for user at the time of adding item to board. (solution: can have ranks for boards by using content, usage, personalization)
            2. Lots of addition to development => more time 
            
    3. Mixed :
        merge 1 and 2
            1. similar to google photos share
            2. public boards can be like wiki
