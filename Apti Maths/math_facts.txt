//square of natural number never ends with 2, 3, 7, 8 it ends with 0 1 4 5 6 9 

//
x^n + a^n will be divisible by x+a only when n is odd.
x^n - a^n will be divisible by x+a only whne n is even.



//a number successivly divided by 4,5, 6 gives reminder 2, 3, 4 then whats the no?

4 	x
5	y-2
6	z-3
	1-4

	z = 6* 1 + 4 = 10
	y = 5 * z + 3 = 53
	x = 4 * y + 2 = 212

//Find day of Week :
	remember one day 1 jan 1900 was monday.
	every 400 years later, it remains same, so skip multiple of 400.
	every 100 years has 5 odd days, so its shfited by 5 days after each 100 years.
	every normal year it shifts by 1 day and for leap year shifts by 2 days.

	leap year = if year is divisible by 4 && not divisible by 100.
							divisible by 4 && divisible by 100 && divisible by 400.
