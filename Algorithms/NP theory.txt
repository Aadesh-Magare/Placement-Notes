some problems cant be solved by computer even with unlimited time e.g. 
	turing halting problem : given program and a input, determining if that program will run forever or terminate.


//NP-Complete problem : 
	whoes status is unknown. no poly time algorithm has been discovered for them nor anyone has proved that it doesnt exist.
	if any one of them can be solved then all of them can be solved.

// P :
	these are problems that can be solved in polynomial time by deterministic turing machine.

// NP :
	these can be solved in polynomial time by non-deterministic turing machine.

	P is subset of NP.

//NP hard 
	NP complete is subset of NP hard.
