//Subsets :
	there are 2^n subsets of n elements.

//Permutations :
	
	with repetations :
		n * n * n ... 

		n ^ r

	without repetations :
		n * n-1 * n-2 ... =  n!

		if upto r terms then its equal to 
			nPr = n! / (n-r)!

//Combinations :
	
	with repetations :
		to choose r items from set of n items where repetation is allowed.

		(n + r - 1)Cr


	without repetations :

		to choose r items from set of n items 
			nCr = n! / r! * (n-r)!


	//Important property for DP calculations of nCr :

		nCr = (n-1)C(r-1) + (n-1)Cr 

		nC0 = 1 and nCn = 1 

//Fibonacci numbers :
	
	Fn = 1 / sqrt(5) [ (1 + sqrt(5) / 2) ^ n - (1 - sqrt(5) / 2)^ n]

//Catalan numbers :
	has many applications such as : no of balanced paranthesis, no of triangulations in polygon, no of rooted binary tree with n+1 leaves.

		Cn = 1 / (n+1) * 2nCn

//Eulerian numbers :
	


//Stirling numbers :


//Set partitions :


//Integer Partition :
	how can an interger be partitioned into different sets such that sum of all integers in each set equals original no.

		function F(n, k) gives no of partitions of n with largest part k
			F(n, k) = F(n-k, k) + F(n, k-1)

			F(1,1) = 1;
			F(n, k = 0 when k > n
