Time Complexity:

the order of time is 
 
 logn < n< nlogn < n^2 < 2^n < n!

 Big Oh (O) : Upper Bound
 Big Omega : lower bound
 Big Theta :  in between, both upper and lower bound

 //Profiling :
 	 The process of generating a statistical analysis of a program that shows processor time and the percentage of program execution time used by each procedure in the program.
