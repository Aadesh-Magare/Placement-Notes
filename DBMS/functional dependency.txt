//Canonical Cover

an attribute is extraneous if we can remove it without changing the closure.
A canonical cover for F is (Fc) set of F.D. such that F logically implies all of F.D.in Fc and Fc logically implies all F.D. in F
also 
no F.D. in Fc contains extraneous attributes, each left side of F.D. in Fc is unique.

conside F :
a->bc
b->c
a->b
ab->c
then Fc will be.
a->b
b->c

steps to find canonical cover:
1. convert F.D in such way that right side has only one term
2. remove duplicates
