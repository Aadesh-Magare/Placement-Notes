When we decompose a relation into two or more relations there may be two types of decompositions 
lossy-decomposition and lossless decomposition

a Decomposition is loseless if:
R having (F.D. F) is decomposed into R1 and R2
then if  one of this is in F^+
R1 intersection R2 --> R1 
R1 intersection R2 --> R2 


normalization of database is like optimization.


nomal forms

1NF - no repeating columns	(eliminate repeated groups.)
e.g.
consider table
id		name		child1		child2		child3
1 		aaaa		aaaa 		bbbb		cccc

here columns are repeated. if someone comes with 4 children then its a problem


2NF- non key attributes should depend on full primary key and not on parts of primary key


3NF - all non key attributes should be directly dependent on primary key and not transitivly.
