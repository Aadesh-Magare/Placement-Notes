// Dangling Tuple :
	in case of natural join when a tuple does not join with any other in other relation then that tuple is called dangling tuple

// Unique attribute : its used to declare candidate key
	the set of attributes declare unique forms the candidate key
	uniquness constraint is violated only if all the attributes have same value and all of them are nonnull.
	so even if any one attribute has a null value then its not violated even if rest values are same.
