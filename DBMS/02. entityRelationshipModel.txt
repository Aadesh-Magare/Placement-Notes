// ER model is used to create conceptual model of database.
// Entity : an object with physical or conceptual existence.
    represented by a rectangle.
// Entity Set : set of all entities of a type is called entity set.
    represented by a vertical oval.
// Attributes : properties of an entity.
    represented by an oval.
// Key Attribute : attribute which uniquely identifies each entity. e.g. roll_no
    represented by an oval with underlying lines.
    
    // Weak Entity type : entities for which key attribute is not defined.
        It's represented by double rectangle.

// Composite Attribute : attribute which is composed of many other attributes.
    represented by an oval comprising of ovals.
// Multivalued Attribute : attribute having more than one value for given entity.
    represented by double oval.
// Derived Attribute : attribute that can be derived from other attributes.
    represented by dashed oval.
// Relationship Type : it's association between entities.
    represented by diamond and connecting the entities with lines.
    e.g. enrolled in is relationship type that exists between student and courses entities.
// Relationship Set : set of relationships of same type.
            
    number of different entity sets participating in relationship is degree of relationship set. e.g. if 1, 2 or n entity sets are participating in relationship then it's called unary, binary or n-ary relationship resp.

    number of times an entity of an entity set participates in relationship set is known as cardinality. 

    // one to one :
        each entity can take part only once in the relationship.
    // many to one :
        entities in one set can take part more than once while entities in other set can take part only once.
    // many to many :
        when entities in both sets can take part multiple times.

    // Participation Constraint :    
        // Total Participation :
            each entity in entity set must participate.
            represented by double line in ER (Entity-Relationship) diagram.
        
        // Partial Participation :
            each entity in entity set may or may not participate.
            represented by single line in ER diagram.
        
        Participation of weak entity type is always total. Relationship between weak entity type and it's identifying strong entity type is called identifying relationship and represented by double diamond.

// Minimization of ER diagram / Conversion to Relational Model:

    // Many to one cardinality :
        The relationship table can be merged with table responsible for many cardinality.
        hence minimum two tables are needed for Many to one cardinality.

    // Many to many cardinality :
        we cannot merge the relationship table with either table without causing redundancy.
        hence minimum 3 tables are needed for many to many cardinality.

    // One to one cardinality :
        // Total participation from at-least one end : relationship table can be merged with either of the tables, in-fact all three tables can be merged into one.
        hence minimum 1 table is required for one to one cardinality with total participation.

        // No total participation : relationship table can be merged with either of the tables but all three tables can not be merged without having null fields.
        hence minimum 2 tables are required for one to one cardinality without total participation.
